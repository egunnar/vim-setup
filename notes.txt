Installing plugins reminder:

I use pathogen. Clone repo like:
git clone https://github.com/mtdl9/vim-log-highlighting ~/.vim/bundle/vim-log-highlighting

Go into the newly created folder and delete the .git folder. Then commit the plugin (assuming I like it). Commit it all.

There's some sloppyness here. I lose the history of the plugin. At one point I vaguely remember using git submodules for this process (but something annoyed about submodules for this particular use case). I should commit the git repo url somewhere too so I know where the code comes from. This extreme easy of use out weighs losing the .git folder.

TODO - research and find a better process.
---------------------------------
general:
nmap <leader>w :mksession! ~/session.vim<cr>
nmap <leader>l :source ~/session.vim<cr>

---------------------------------------
To run code formating do:
:Autoformat

There is basic functionality out of the box but I should install a external
tool and have it in the path.

----------------------------------
ctags:
ctags -R --languages=Python *
gives only 5MB file at worstish

not the --python-kinds=-i get of going to the import statement as a definition (which is annoying)
ctags -R --python-kinds=-i --languages=Python *

doing a full ctags can generate a 300MB file for some projects
